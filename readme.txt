Hi. That is my first project.
I made CPU/RAM load monitor for your PC on python.
I used classical library tkinter, sys, also I used psutil for working with CPU and RAM datas.


Main.py - starts app and creates tkinter UI
cpu_work.py - gets cpu and ram datas
configurates_widg.py - configures UI from main.py
